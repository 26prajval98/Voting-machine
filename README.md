# Voting-machine
Voting machine which uses blockchain.

Percentage of people who vote has become very less. The main reason to this is people find it difficult to go to the voting booth and cast vote.  What if people can vote from their home ?

This would mean more people are voting, less people are influenced by others so one can provide their true opinion and make the results of elections what people truly want.

We would be tackling this problem.

Applicable for all the elections where voter has an identity.
